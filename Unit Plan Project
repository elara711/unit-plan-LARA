## Unit Plan Project
The final project for this class will be a unit plan.
* You may work individually, opr in groups up to 3 people large.
* Unit plan for a course/unit you have not taught.
* The plan must cover at least a two week long unit.
  - This may vary depending on your particular school schedule. Consider 10 ~45 minute periods.
* The unit should culminate in a provided formal assessment.
  - This could be a project, presentation, test, etc.
* The unit should contain all lessons, materials and assignments.
* Everyone will present their unit plan over the course of the last few class sessions.
* There will be class time for unit plan work & feedback.

Unit plans will be evaluated based on the following Criteria:
- Unit size: Does your unit cover the prescribed 2 weeks - 45 minute a day, amount of work.
- Unit lesson content: do each of the lessons/activities have enough material for another teacher to deliver the content.
  - Lessons should be full lesson plans that someone else (that understands the language) could use to deliver the intended unit.
  - This includes all student facing materials (assessments, notes, assignments, etc) as well as teacher facing materials (lecture/discussion content, key points, prompts, solutions, etc)
- Unit standards: Is the content aligned with state standards, are the standards clearly indicated.
- Unit lesson flow / cohesion: Are your lessons sequenced in a sensible way, do they build upon prior lessons.
- Selection of tools: Are the technical and non-technical tools used in the unit appropriate for the content and intended audience?

__Unit Plan Repository Organization__:

Every Unit Plan repository should have the following.
* Example repository: <https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/unit_plan-example>
* README.md: Unit plan template
* lessons/
  - Folder containing separate folders for each lesson.
  - Each sub-folder should be named __##\_TOPIC__ i.e. __00\_intro__
  - A lesson plan should be a pdf file.
    - We will not specify a specific format for lesson plans, but each one should include all lesson components including (but not limited to):
      - Main objective
      - Standards
      - In class exercises
      - Notes
      - Resources
      - Assignments
  - Each lesson folder should only contain:
    - PDF files
    - Source code files
    - Images
* assessments/
  - Any assessments & their associated rubrics
  - Even if the assessment is also in a lesson folder, it should also be placed in this folder.
